# 🚦 Traffic Predictor

An intelligent real-time traffic prediction system that combines:

* 🌦 Weather conditions
* 🕒 Time & day analysis
* 🚗 Live traffic flow data
* 📍 Route visualization
* 📊 Historical traffic records
* 🤖 ML-based traffic scoring

The project predicts traffic congestion levels and visualizes routes on an interactive map using the TomTom Maps API.

# ⚙️ Installation

## 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash id="ynqk9j"
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
```

---

## 2️⃣ Install Backend Dependencies

```bash id="n2o7ch"
cd backend
npm install
```

---

# 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside backend folder.

```env id="l2lyct"
PORT=5000

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

TOMTOM_API_KEY=your_tomtom_api_key

WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
```

---

# ▶️ Run Backend

```bash id="iw2wuj"
node server.js
```

Server runs on:

```text id="h41af3"
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

# ▶️ Run Frontend

Open:

```text id="r9kl0m"
frontend/index.html
```

using Live Server or browser.

---

# 📊 Traffic Prediction Logic

The final traffic score is calculated using:

```text id="c3r7b3"
Traffic Score =
Time Factor +
Day Factor +
Weather Factor +
Traffic Index
```

Advanced traffic index includes:

* Distance normalization
* Peak hour boost
* Weather multiplier
* Historical learning

---

# 🧠 Traffic Levels

| Score Range | Traffic Level |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 0 – 0.4     | Low           |
| 0.4 – 0.7   | Medium        |
| > 0.7       | High          |

---

# 🗺️ Route Visualization

Traffic route colors:

* 🟢 Green → Low
* 🟡 Yellow → Medium
* 🔴 Red → High

---

# 📸 Screenshots
